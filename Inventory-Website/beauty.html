            <h2>What is Nail Paint?</h2>

           <p> Nail paint, also known as nail polish, is a cosmetic product applied to the nails to provide color, protection, and decoration. It can be used for both aesthetic purposes and to enhance the appearance of nails.</p>
           <h2> Key Components of Nail Paint</h2>
            <dl>
               <dt> Base Coat:</dt>
                    <dd>The base coat is applied first to protect the nails from staining by the colored polish. It helps to smooth the nail surface and creates a good foundation for the color.
                    Common Ingredients: Nitrocellulose, Formaldehyde resin, and plasticizers.
                </dd>
               <dt> Color Pigments:</dt>
                   <dd> These are responsible for giving nail paint its vibrant or subtle color. Pigments come in various forms: liquid, powder, or gel.
                    Common Pigments: Iron oxide (for reds/browns), Titanium dioxide (for white), Mica (for shimmer), and various synthetic dyes.</dd>
            
               <dt> Solvents:</dt>
                   <dd> Solvents help the nail polish to spread smoothly on the nails and evaporate after application, leaving the color behind. They also prevent the polish from drying out in the bottle.
                    Common Solvents: Ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol.</dd>

   <dt> Aroma Compounds (Synthetic or Natural):</dt>
